# Auditable #
An easy to implement attribute audit log for Eloquent ORM in Laravel 4.X.

## Installation
Add the repository to your `composer.json`:

	"repositories": [
	    {
	        "type": "vcs",
	        "url": "https://github.com/olsgreen/laravel-auditable"
	    }
	],

and also require `Auditable`:

	
	"require": {
		"laravel/framework": "4.1.*",
		"olsgreen/laravel-guardian": "dev-master",
	},
Run `composer update` to update your app or `composer install` to install.

After install / update you will need to run the packages migrations like so:

	php artisan migrate --package="olsgreen/laravel-auditable"

and also add `Auditable` as a service provider within your `app/config/app.php`:

	'providers' => array(

		'Illuminate\Foundation\Providers\ArtisanServiceProvider',
		'Illuminate\Auth\AuthServiceProvider',
		..........

		// Auditable - add this line below the others
		'Olsgreen\Auditable\AuditableServiceProvider',
	),

After this you'll be ready to go.

## Getting started
Auditable offers two methods of implementation:

1. Inheritance, by using our `AuditableModel` as a base class.
2. Adding a model event observer.

### Using Auditable via inheritance
To come.

### Using Auditable via a model event observer
Import the Obeser in your model

	use Olsgreen\Auditable\Observer;

Add observer to your model

	User::observe(new Observer);

Provide representation to your model.

	public $represent = 'first_name'; 
	//or
	public $represent = 'country_name';
